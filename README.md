## Overview

Eidolon is a fork of [Anubis](https://anubis.techaro.lol/), a web AI firewall utility that "[weighs the soul of your connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_of_souls)" to protect your site from scraper bots.

We at Estrogen.gg forked this project so we would be able to customize it for use on our platform. In a day and age where AI companies do nothing but flood you with requests for content, you need a shield. Eidolon is meant to be that shield.

As the original Anubis readme says, Eidolon is a nuclear response. It blocks bots, bad, and sometimes good. You are able to configure [bot policy definitions](./docs/docs/admin/policies.mdx) to allowlist the bots you want to have access, while keeping the bad ones at bay. Both Estrogen.gg and Anubis are working on a curated set of "good" bots.

We at Estrogen.gg use Eidolon because lets face it... Sometimes, CloudFlare doesn't cut it. Sometimes, they have issues that piss off users and drive traffic away from your site.

If you want to try this out, we suggest that you use Anubis, the original program.
